### Predeclared Types and Declarations
> Go has many types built into the language. These are called predeclared types.
> They are similar to types that are found in other languages: booleans, integers, floats, and strings.

> Go, like most modern languages, assigns a default zero value to any variable that is declared but not assigned a value.

#### Literals
- An integer literal is a sequence of numbers.
- A floating-point literal has a decimal point to indicate the fractional portion of the value.
- A rune literal represents a character and is surrounded by single quotes.
- string literals

... largely consistent with other languages.

#### Practice
- Will create a github repo to track data structures and algorithms in Go.
