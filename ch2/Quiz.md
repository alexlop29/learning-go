### Analysis
Your answers look great overall, but let's double-check to ensure everything aligns with the concepts from Learning Go, 2nd Edition:
a) float64
Correct! float64 is indeed a predeclared type in Go, along with types like int, bool, and string.
b) 0
Correct! The default zero value for int in Go is 0.
var
Correct! The var keyword is used to declare variables in Go.
a) var x int = 10
Correct! This is a valid declaration in Go. The shorthand := could also be used, but the example provided is valid.
b) It gets the default zero value for its type.
Correct! Uninitialized variables in Go automatically get the default zero value of their type.
a) Declares a new variable and assigns a value.
Correct! The := operator is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable in one step.
b) rune
Correct! The rune type represents a Unicode code point in Go.
b) const name = value
Correct! Constants in Go are declared with the const keyword.
c) 123variable
Correct! Identifiers cannot start with a digit in Go.
d) To declare custom types.
Incorrect. The purpose of iota is b) To define sequential constants.
iota is used in constant declarations to automatically increment values starting from zero.
